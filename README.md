# CZ2XX1-Algorithms
Found my algorithms lab solutions.  
Decided to host on github for safe keeping purposes.  
Tried and tested on eclipse IDE.

### Lab2 hashing
Compare linear probing and double hashing collision handling methods.

### Lab3 Sorting
Compare MergeSort and QuickSort algorithms on random, ascending and descending datasets.

### Lab3 Searching
A Implementation of breath first search algorithm.  
Future modifications: use mutable string datatype to prevent memory shortage in large search graphs.
